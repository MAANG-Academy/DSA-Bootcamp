## Introduction

The curriculum is designed to upskill the software engineer from elementary proficiency in problem solving to an expert in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). In the first 10 weeks of the program, the student will learn all the data structures & algorithms commonly used, and solve questions based on that. DSA Level II (weeks 12-21) will focus on solving DSA questions that are commonly asked in interviews of top tech companies. This will also enable the learner write the most optimised code in terms of time and space complexity.

Consistent practice is needed to get good at DSA. Creating a personal habit tracker to journal the no. of questions, time spent daily etc. will help build consistency, a state of flow and confidence.

Spaced repetition, also known as distributed practice, is an extremely effective approach for internalizing knowledge into long-term memory. By doing questions across a variety of topics each week, and revisiting the topic again in subsequent weeks, you get to build on the learnings from the past weeks and become better at solving questions from that topic. 

Maintain a notebook to write down every problem with their solutions/learnings. Revise them periodically throughout the duration of course.

Although DSA might seem challenging initially, things start falling in place once we develop the right intuition for problem solving with practice. The optimal solutions of most problems are within 10 lines of code.



## Guidelines

The recommended languages for DSA interviews are Python, Java or C++. 

Since this is a self paced course, the student can customise the curriculum to suit their time commitments, competence levels and accordingly create a study plan. A schedule that will help cover the complete curriculum would be:
2hrs in morning, 2hrs in evening. 5-10 questions/day.

DSA interviews are used as an elimination criteria in companies. You are expected to typically solve the given question in ~30 min in tests & interviews. Strictly keep track of time while solving problems as part of this course. **Dont spend more than 30 min on any one problem.** If you cant come up with a solution logic in 5-10 min, that means you are yet to learn the particular technique or pattern needed to solve the given question. So straightaway refer the solution given, learn it and code it up. If needed, you can also go through Leetcode Discussions to see the top solutions, and videos online explaining the Leetcode solutions.

Make use of the peer group effect to push each other and the batch performance upwards. The batch can conduct timed mock interview amongst each other or timed focus sprints for solving questions in a muted virtual meet mimicking a study group.   

## Self Assesment criterias

1. Difficulty level of the question: Easy-> Medium -> Hard.
2. Time taken to solve the question.
3. Communicate the solution and code clearly to the interviewer.
